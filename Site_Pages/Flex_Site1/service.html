	  Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
	  The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised
	  code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization.
	  Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.

  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>
   Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections 
   on material culture and environmental concerns (sustainable design) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the First
   Things First manifesto which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities 
   in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication â€“ a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the
   exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is 
   running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.
